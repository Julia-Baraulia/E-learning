# Project e-learning
The main objective is to answer the following questions:

How many students successfully completed only one course? 

What the most challenging and the easiest exams?

What the average time to complete exams for each subject? 

Identify the most popular subjects (TOP-3) based on the number of registrations. Also, find subjects with the highest attrition rates (TOP-3). 

Identify the semester with the lowest course completion rates and the longest average course completion times, during the period from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014?

Create adapted RFM clusters of students to qualitatively assess your audience. The following metrics: R - average time to complete one exam, F - course completion rates, M - average score obtained on exams.
